These are the materials needed to create and host a set of webtask node.js scripts.

**Instructions for creating the webtasks locally**

- brew install npm
- wt init (and login. this will only work if you have an account I believe)
- cd to the folder where the js is located. 
- wt create {name of scripe}.js
- use the url provided
